# About BonXai
BonXai is a user-friendly alternative to XML Schema. Its aim is to offer a means of specifying a large class of XML Schema documents in a simple way.

As a proof of concept, we implemented a prototype tool that can convert

- from DTD to BonXai and
- between XML Schema and BonXai.

One standard workflow is to create a BonXai schema (possibly translated from a DTD), edit it, and translate it to XML Schema.

The goal of BonXai is not to replace XML Schema, but rather to provide a simpler alternative for users who want to go beyond the expressiveness and features of DTD, but do not need the explicit use of types. Furthermore, XML Schema processing tools can be used as a back-end for BonXai, since BonXai can be automatically converted into XML Schema.
