Questions raised by Reviewers:
==============================
1) Can you describe how FoxLib was tested? Which users tried
it and how did you incorporate feedback?

=> Wim cleverly remarked that in the DOW, we only mention unit tests. 
We do not promise user tests. Maybe we can still ask students to
write a project on top op foxlib?


2) Can you apply the regular expression simplification algorithms
   in the translation algorithms (Bonxai)?

=> Matthias remarked that we can always put Wouter's code in Bonxai! 
Matthias might implement his own algorithm.

Next Actions:
* Asses how well Wouters' code works on the translations in the demo
* Add Wouter's code to FoxLib
* Write an interface how to access the important functions
* Write small documentation on how to use it
* Implement own algorithm 


3) Can you describe which subset of XML Schema Bonxai can cope with?
Responsibles: Matthias and Thomas.



General todo:
=============

According to D1.2 (attached)

1) Add XML inference module (cf Section 2.1.1, code of Geert jan).
Add capability to transform abstract format to XSD format.

Responsibles: Timos, Jonny, and Matthias.


2) Add XSD similarity module (cf. Section 2.1.2, code of Dominique)

Responsibles: Timos and Jonny.


3) Add XSD key inference module (cf Section 2.1.3, code of Jonny)

Responsibles: Jonny.


4) Add regular expression simplification module (cf. Section 2.1.4, code of Jeroen)

Responsibles: Timos and Jonny


5) Show evidence for tighter integration. (cf Section 2.2)

Responsibles: Matthias and Thomas.

6) Testing and debugging. (cf. Section 2.3)

Responsibles: Matthias and Thomas.

7) Deploying of the library

Demo's:
=======


* FoxLib targeted at VLDB
Deadline: April 1.
http://www.vldb2012.org/call-for-contributions/important-dates/
authors: Timos, Thomas T, Thomas S, Jonny, Frank, Wim (did I forget anybody?)

Next Action: 
* UHasselt plans meeting to think about demo outline
* UHasselt prepares demo skeleton


Real World Data analysis
========================

Maarten Marx wrote a paper about this.
Next Action:
* Frank asks the paper, reads it, and reports back to it for next meeting


Meeting met jonny en Timos?
